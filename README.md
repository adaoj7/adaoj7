- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Adam Johnson. (Adao is Portuguese for Adam) I am a new father, a lover of soccer and golf, and an advocate of people and strong connections.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a college and bootcamp graduate specializing in React. I love the challenge that code provides and I am actively seeking opportunities as a Web Developer or Software Engineer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a website for the Peoria Area Community Festival of Nativities built with React, Node with Express, and Postgres using an EC2 server to host the website. Check out the first draft at https://adamj-developer.com or check out my portfolio at https://adaoj.dev
