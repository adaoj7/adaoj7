Hi, my name is Adam Johnson.

Iâ€™m a BYUI and Devmountain graduate specializing in React. I love developing software and I am actively seeking opportunities as a Front-End or Full-Stack Software Engineer.

Iâ€™m currently working on a website for the Peoria Area Community Festival of Nativities built with React, Node with Express, and Postgres using Docker and a Digital Ocean Droplet. Check out the first draft at https://adamj-developer.com, the final site at https://pc-fn.org or check out my portfolio at https://adaoj.dev

I am also a seasoned leader with experience working with small and large teams helping them to be their best. I love the meaning that leadership provides and the chance to impact those that I lead. 

I love soccer, golf, Nebraska football, a good burger, and my family.
