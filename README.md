Hi, my name is Adam Johnson.

Iâ€™m a BYUI and Devmountain graduate specializing in React with Typescript. I love developing software. I am not actively seeking, but please feel free to reach out with any opportunities.

Iâ€™m currently working on a website for the Peoria Area Community Festival of Nativities built using React with Typescript, Node with Express, and Postgres. It's hosted using Docker, Caddy, and a Digital Ocean Droplet. Check out the first draft at https://adamj-developer.com, the final site at https://pc-fn.org or check out my portfolio at https://adaoj.dev

I am also a seasoned leader with experience working with small and large teams working with them to be their best. I love the meaning that leadership provides and the chance to impact those that I lead. 

I love soccer, golf, Nebraska football, a good burger, and my family.
